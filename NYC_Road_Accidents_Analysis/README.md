## NYC_Road_Accident_Analysis

## 1.Source
-  We will be using Motor_Vehicle.csv and lat_long_csv datasets for building this analysis dashboard.
-  Second step would be to write a streamlit app that uses the above datasets to analyse the accidents in specific areas over a period of time with 3 clases
-  [Class_1:'Pedestrians', Class_2:'Cyclists', Class_3:'Motorists']
-  Technology and tools wise this project covers,
-    1.Python
-    2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
-    3.Matplotlib for data visualization
-    4.Sklearn for model building
-    5.visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
-    6.Python Streamlit an open source app framework for our UI and https requests
-    7.Git and Github for our source code version control

## 2.Features
- Simple responsive UI Dashboard designed to analyze Road Accidents in New York City
- Areas where most people are injured: Select Number of persons injured [ 0 ====> 19]
- Number of accidents occuring during a given time of the day: Select Hour of the day [ 0 ====> 23]
- Plot shows the areas where Road Accidents occur between 00:00 and 23:00
- Check Show raw data [/] to get the Raw data by minute between 00:00 and 23:00
- Plot minutes vs crashes: Breakdown by minute between 00:00 and 23:00
- Top 5 affected streets by class: Select from the following clases ['Pedestrians', 'Cyclists', 'Motorists']


## 3.Usage
- Clone my repository here ===> ( https://github.com/balusena/balu-ds-streamlitapps/tree/main/NYC_Road_Accidents_Analysis )
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run following command.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- 'app.py' is the main Python file of Streamlit Web-Application. 
- To run app, write following command in CMD. or use any IDE.
- streamlit run app.py
- run the app app.py by logging into your streamlit account it works as intended when you follow the instruction stated in this document.

## 4.Further work to be done
-1.The current implementation would work well for the datasets we have used for this NYC__Road_Accidents_Analysis
-2.Aiming to work with larger and real-dataset and build an end to end NYC__Road_Accidents_Analysis.
-3.Find a way to analyse the NYC__Road_Accidents_Analysis with above datasets(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this project enhancement.)
